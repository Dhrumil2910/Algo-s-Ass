There are four different classes:
=================================
1) Suffix Array
2) BWT 
3) Wavelet Tree
4) FM-index using all the above

=========================================
Input text should be stored in "input.txt"
Patterns should be stored in "patternFile.txt"

Make sure each pattern is present in a separate line

Example:
========
above
is
There


Graph:
======
It shows how much time each pattern takes

Space Complexity:
=================
Will be shown when you run the main.py
(Analysis: Wavelet tree parses the input text and overall size is lesser than original so its compressed)


How to run:
===========
python main.py
